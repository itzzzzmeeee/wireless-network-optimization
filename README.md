# wireless-network-optimization
A case study report on optimizing wireless network performance and coverage in campus networks, implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer.
---

## Project Details

### Objective:
To design and implement a secure, scalable, and high-performance wireless network for a university campus and its affiliated campus. Key objectives include:
- Establishing end-to-end connectivity between campuses and enabling secure access to an external cloud-hosted email server.
- Segmenting network traffic across departments using VLANs.
- Configuring dynamic routing (RIPv2) and DHCP for efficient communication and IP management.
- Optimizing network performance through Quality of Service (QoS).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** For network design, configuration, and simulation.
- **Dynamic Routing (RIPv2):** For internal communication.
- **Static Routing:** For secure external communication.
- **DHCP:** For dynamic IP allocation.
- **QoS Policies:** To prioritize critical traffic.

---

## Instructions to Run the Simulation
1. Download the `CASE STUDY.pkt` file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Cisco Packet Tracer (version X.X or later).
3. Explore the configurations for VLANs, routing, and security policies.
4. Test the network using ping, traceroute, and other tools to observe inter-VLAN communication, DHCP functionality, and routing.
